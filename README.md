# Simulating-Granular-System-using-LAMMPS

- Using LAMMPS studied the behavior of the 2D system of granular particles.
- Observe the change in the pressure of the system by continuous compressing and decompressing the system.
- Analysed the simulated data by plotting a graph of pressure with packing fraction using MATLAB.
